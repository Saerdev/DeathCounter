# DeathCounter
Automatic death counter for Lies of P.

Overlay is draggable

If using as an OBS overlay, use Window Capture and set Capture Method to Windows 10

You can see the controls in the system try icon tooltip

NOTE: The tracker will not work correctly if you started the program before you created a character. If you did this, simply restart the program and it will update the next time the game autosaves (sitting at a stargazer, switching equipment, dying, etc.)

Decrement: Ctrl + Subtract

Reset: Ctrl + 0

Quit: Ctrl + .

This was just a fun personal project that I made for myself, so the code hasn't been cleaned up since I started using it for Remnant 2.
